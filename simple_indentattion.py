#Python uses indentation for blocks, instead of curly braces. Both tabs and spaces are supported, but the standard indentation requires standard Python code to use four spaces. For example:


x = 2
if x == 1:
    # indented four spaces
    print("x is 1.")
elif x==2:
    # indented four spaces again.
    print("x value is two.")
